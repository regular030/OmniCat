# OMNICAT

For millions of us, Octocat has been a staple part of our lives, a hardworking and cheerful best friend. What would be more wonderful than to extend that friendship to the real world.

What does omnicat do?
Feature 1: RC Car
Omnicat is a 4 wheel drive RC car that can be steered either by a traditional game controller or asynchronously through a Leap Motion Sensor with the gesture tracking bindings demonstrated in the video:
Open palm: forward; Fist: backward; Pointer: right; Peace: left; Hang Ten: mode switch

Feature 2: Git Desk Decoration
The OLED on the back displays live details about your Github that are important for easy access, such as number of stars or pull requests on a target repository. You can switch through the display modes using your controller/depth sensor.

Hello! This is our submission project for Hack Club's Highway Hackathon at Github HQ.
With the mission to build something intricate, wacky and helpful, we decided to build a personal home assistant:
none other than Octocat itself!
