### Our Team

Hello! We are team KDA and we made Omnicat: Octocat 2.0 as a practical, exciting and theme-fitting project to submit for Highway.
Here is our build process over the 4 days we are attending at Github HQ.

### Day 1 [July 11th]: Getting the Plan in Motion
Action Items Completed:
- Familiarizing ourselves with the LeapMotion interface and its abilities in Unity.
- Deciding general parts and robot dimensions, proceeded with Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and simple DC motors.

Goals:
We wanted to arrive at the venue early to look around, scout for parts, make friends and get our setup adjusted. We made sure that we brought several spare parts in case of shortages, and when the ceremony completed, we started brainstorming our project idea (decided to dedicate today to fleshing out the idea). We combined our strengths to create the Omnicat for the following:
* As frequent builders/coders, we could envision ourselves using this frequently as a desk item for reviewing our Github activity and if needed, self defense.
* Doing everything, from using the depth sensor to the PCB mill, was all completely new to us and helpful to our learning.
* It challenged us to use the parts available to us and refine our CAD.

Total time spent: 12hx3

### Day 2 [July 12th]: Fleshing out the Design 
Action Items Completed:
- Designed a PCB to simplify motor driver control and camera module through Raspberry Pi
- Finished the entire CAD for the robot, including the primary body with legs to hold the wheels, the omnicat head, turret pipe, flywheels, and drive wheels. 

Goals:
Today we wanted to completely finish our CAD/PCB and save tomorrow fully for developing and troubleshooting the hardware and software. We picked out all our electrical components, finished the model, fully designed and printed the PCB, 

Hitches:
The queue for the CAD was quite long but we could print in the end (just as filament was almost out) and we discovered it would be impossible to conveniently control the motors backwards without the driver a friend graciously lent us. 

Total time spent: 24hx3

### Day 3 [July 13th]: Putting Everything Together
Action Items Completed:
- Got 3D parts at 3PM
- Finshed basic prototype
- Wrote and successfully ran code for hand coordinates extraction and for camera module till ->
HUGE HITCH: All the Pi mobile vehicle teams at Highway suffer a major problem: the raspberry pis mysteriously stop responding in mass and consistently time out. Luckily we are able to salvage a majority of our components but the CV camera module did have to go.
- Switched to the ESP32 and made pin assignments more efficient to overcome our issue :D

Total time spent: 24hx3

### Day 4 [July 14th]: Final Stretch
Action Items Completed:
- Fully finished the omnicat!
- Added OLED to final product
- Improved depth sensing gesture detection with additional training data.
- Added Github REST API to display user's GH stats

Total time spent: 12hx3

## Final Ship and Outcome
